# Overview
As a software engineering student exploring file processing and text analysis in C++, I created this project to deepen my understanding of file I/O, data structures like maps, and basic text parsing techniques.

This software reads a text file, analyzes the content, and counts how many times each word appears. It filters out punctuation, converts words to lowercase, and displays the results both in the console and in an output file. The project emphasizes simple natural language processing concepts such as tokenization, normalization, and frequency analysis.

The goal was to build a command-line tool that handles real-world text data and demonstrates practical skills like file reading, stream processing, and data organization using the STL.
